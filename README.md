## Welcome to Portflow x Next.js

**Portflow** is a portfolio web template build with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs), [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). By using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 13, this will take care of the rest of *repeatable components, enable rich-content, quick navigation, optimize page speed and dynamic SEO friendly*. So this way more **recommended** for production purpose. For now, **Portflow** only provide page layouts for simple Article or Blog UI like [Medium](https://medium.com/). Any future development update will be announced on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agil3st/) profile.

> Portflow may contains another combination of components from [TailwindCSS Components](https://tailwindcomponents.com/) and DaisyUI Components

## Getting Started

I recommend you to learn basic concept of starting [Portflow HTML template](https://github.com/agil3st/portflow) before you step forward. If you already have an experience with [JavaScript frameworks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks), look at the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) to learn more.

### Setup

```bash
# yarn (recommended)
yarn install
# npm
npm install
# pnpm
pnpm install
```

#### Development Server

```bash
# yarn (recommended)
yarn dev
# npm
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
